# Pre Review

Bind to a pre-review workflow, this is script that pre-review each PR contributions.

It provides custom feedback based on the submissions at
a folder level (general feedback) and at a file level (feedback per files handled).

- E.g.: General feedback / folder level: file(s) missing, space contained in folder/file, file outside `Art/`...
- E.g.: File level feedback / file handled (html, css, json)

## ⚙️ How it works

```mermaid
graph LR
    Workflow["Workflow: pre-review.yml"] --> Collect
    subgraph " "
        subgraph Collect ["Collects PR info for script"]
            Info(( )) --> CONTRIBUTOR(PR author)
            Info --> GITHUB_PERMISSION_ROLE(PR author role)
            Info --> PR_NUMBER(PR number)
            Info --> PR_GITHUB_HANDLE(GitHub handle)
            Info --> CHANGED_FILES(PR changed files)
        end
    end
    Collect --> Script["Script: PreReview.js
                with info"]

```

### 🔹 Good to know

The script is able to:

- **Acknowledge the author's role** and **provide custom feedback accordingly**.
  - **admin** | **maintain** : feedback outside `Art/` are skipped, inside `Art/` remains  
    _(e.g.: Maintainer doing non contribution work \ Maintainer doing the challenge /)_
  - **unknown** ( any non-maintainer ): will provide feedbacks for (in/out-side `Art/`)
- **Label PR**: based on the feedback output, the workflow will label the PR

  - `Changes Requested`: if any feedback are provided
  - `Awaiting Maintainer Validation`: if pre-review did not generated feedback
  - `hacktoberfest-accepted`: alongside `Awaiting Maintainer Validation` only if PR are occuring in October.

  Labels are removed automatically upon PR corrections.  
  _(except 'hacktoberfest-accepted' is assigned)_

### 🔹 Pre-review structure

```sh
🗂️ ./generators/pre-review
├── REAMDE.PRE-REVIEW.md    # Current Readme file
├── preReview.checkers.js
├── preReview.constants.js  # Constants driving script
├── preReview.helpers.js
├── preReview.js            # Main script
└── preReview.reviewers.js
```

### 🔹 Terminologies

`constants`: Also holds configurable variables if project the grows

`helpers`: Main script high-level helpers for main logic implementation  
_( contributionStates, helpers functions , ...)_

`checkers`: Checkers for scoped category review
_( globally, HTML, CSS, JSON )_

`reviewers`: Responsible for generating feedback.

- Overal reviewer functions: establish feedback without checking file content
- Individual reviewer functions: establish feedback per file and its content
