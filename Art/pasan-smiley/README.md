Smyley Bouncing — Animation Nation contribution

This folder contains a small CSS-only looping animation suitable for the zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation contribution.

Files:
- index.html — the animation markup
- styles.css — the animation styles
- meta.json — required metadata (edit with your GitHub handle and any changes)

How to add to Animation-Nation:
1. Fork https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation
2. Create a branch from master
3. Copy this folder into the project's `Art/` directory and rename it to `<yourgithub>-smyley-bouncing`
4. Update `meta.json` with your GitHub handle and (optionally) a different `artName`
5. Commit, push to your fork, and open a PR

Notes:
- No JavaScript, images, or SVGs are included — this follows the project's rules.
- Keep only the three required files in your contribution folder (index.html, styles.css, meta.json).
