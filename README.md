## 🔥 Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

### 1. Fork This Repository

Forking creates a copy of this project on your GitHub account. Need help? Check out these resources:

- [Start Here Guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines)
- [How to Fork a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Once forked, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Animation-Nation.git
```
### 3. Create A Branch

Working in the master or main branch is often frowned upon and are usually expected to branch off. Branching also helps to reduce the chance of a merge conflict.

### 4. Create Your Artwork

Now for the fun part! Inside the `Art/` folder:

- Create a new directory named: <github_username>-<art_name> eg. `mattcsmith-helloworld`.
- Inside **your** folder, create an `index.html` file
- Inside **your** folder, create an `styles.css` file
- Inside **your** folder, create an `meta.json` file   
to specify your art name, github author and github link  
Note: copy the following snippet and replace only the values with your own details,  
Do not change the JSON keys.
```json
// Example
{
    "artName": "hello world",
    "githubHandle": "mattcsmith"
}
```
- Use these to create your **animated artwork** — let your creativity flow!

⚠️ It is important to name the directory and your files exactly as mentioned above ⚠️

### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

After completing your artwork, you are now ready to create a pull request and have it added to the collection.
Remembering to first pull down the recent changes from to the upstream, commit your changes, push them to your forked repo, and submit a PR. If you're unfamiliar with pull requests, check out the following resources or drop a message in the Hacktoberfest channel on Discord.
